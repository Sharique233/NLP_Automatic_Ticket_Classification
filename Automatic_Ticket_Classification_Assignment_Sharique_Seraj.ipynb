such fake checks were cleared from my checking account normally i would rarely write any checks in the past i wrote probably one check a month or so\\n\\nchase proceeded to approve these transactions and cleared funds from my account i was alerted to this happening by automated email from chase about my account being overdrawn in addition to fraudulent transactions chase charged three separate overdraft fees to my account \\n\\nupon receiving an alert and realizing the problem on  i contacted chase by phone then visited the branch where i opened a claim with chase chase froze the account and informed that it would take  days to process my claim\\n\\ntwo weeks later as of  chase has not refunded my money  around   and is claiming that the investigation is still ongoing \\n\\ni asked why chase can not proceed with reimbursing me while their investigation is ongoing but did not receive a satisfactory response \\n\\nessentially the same can happen to anybody with a chase checking

such fake checks were cleared from my checking account normally i would rarely write any checks in the past i wrote probably one check a month or so\\n\\nchase proceeded to approve these transactions and cleared funds from my account i was alerted to this happening by automated email from chase about my account being overdrawn in addition to fraudulent transactions chase charged three separate overdraft fees to my account \\n\\nupon receiving an alert and realizing the problem on  i contacted chase by phone then visited the branch where i opened a claim with chase chase froze the account and informed that it would take  days to process my claim\\n\\ntwo weeks later as of  chase has not refunded my money  around   and is claiming that the investigation is still ongoing \\n\\ni asked why chase can not proceed with reimbursing me while their investigation is ongoing but did not receive a satisfactory response \\n\\nessentially the same can happen to anybody with a chase checking
